Project overview
- This project's goal is to allow friends, colegues, etc. to track the small favors they are doing to each other. This is done by beer boards. The initiator is creating board and is adding participants to it (people who he own beers :D ). Each time they do something for him, he is adding one beer (round) to the board. Then, when the time is come, they go out and consume the amount of beer on the initiator's board. The bigger goal of the project is to stimulate people share some good time together face to face, help them socialize with others and share good ideas, findings, concepts etc.

- This project is created using React, CSS and the SoftUni's practice server and does not claim to be exhaustive.
